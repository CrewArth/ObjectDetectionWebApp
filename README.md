# ObjectDetectionWebApp
This project is an Object Detection Web App built using a fine-tuned YOLO (You Only Look Once) model specifically trained on the BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection) dataset. The app allows users to upload images and detect various types of blood cells, showcasing the power of deep learning and computer vision in biomedical applications.
