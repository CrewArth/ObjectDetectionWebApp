# 🎉 Object Detection Web App 🎉

Welcome to the **Object Detection Web App**! 🚀 This application leverages a fine-tuned **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model to detect various types of blood cells in images from the **BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection)** dataset. Let’s dive in! 🎈

## 🌟 Features

- **📸 Upload and Detect:** Upload images of blood samples and watch as the app detects and highlights different types of blood cells!
- **🧠 Intelligent Detection:** Fine-tuned YOLO model trained specifically on the BCCD dataset for accurate results.
- **🎨 User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, intuitive design that makes interaction a breeze.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **YOLOv11:** Fast and efficient object detection model.
- **Flask:** Lightweight web framework for creating the app.
- **OpenCV:** Powerful computer vision library for image processing.
- **HTML/CSS & JavaScript:** Front-end technologies for a beautiful interface.
